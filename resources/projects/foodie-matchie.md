#### _This was a final project for CSC690 at SFSU._

In this project, we were required to build an iOS application. 
We decided to implement an application which shows nearby restaurants according to their selection of distance.
Users can decide whether they want to try this new place and get information about it or don't with swiping right or left.
After user likes the restaurant, we are presenting its menu, location in map and more details about the restaurant.
Afterwards users can see previously liked restaurants.

- We used SwiftUI for the client side. It was so helpful and easier to implement what we needed in the application.
- We used Firebase authentication and storage services in order to make our users sign up and store their liked restaurants.
- We used user's exact location parameters to show a variety of nearby restaurants to the user.
- We fetched restaurant information from DocuMenu API with the help of RapidAPI.
- Show restaurant location in a map view in order to make transportation process easier.
