#### _This was a final project for CSC600 at SFSU._

In this project, we were required to build a musical instrument to play & a visualizer to show notes in different shape.

- Client and server was communicating through SocketIO.
- We used 'ToneJS' in order to play notes with our instruments and load samples to the application
- We were required to build a playlist database. We stored metadata for songs, albums, and artists in the database. This allowed us to implement a filter/search bar
- We used SQLite for DB since it was a relatively small project
- We used tacyhon.css for creating client side layout
